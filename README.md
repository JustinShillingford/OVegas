## The Game

Everybody knows about Texas Hold'em. We love the game so we decided to bring it to the masses in the form of an amazing OCaml Project. Using it as a way to flex our newly earned Functional Programming skills (#MutabilityIsDead), OVegas will surely bring fun to both Poker veterans and newbies looking to form a gambling addiction!


### Installing OCaml

OCaml can take a bit to setup. So you might wanna grab your favorite edition of Cracking the Coding Interview and some Gimme! Coffee while you wait for it to get up and running. Fair warning!

So to set it all up, follow [this link right here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2017fa/install.html). This is the 'Installing OCaml for 3110' guide created by the amazing Professor Michael Clarkson and his 3110 ~~lackeys~~ staff. This is easily the most painless instruction manual for installing OCaml and getting it up and running on your machine. It also includes some quick setup instructions for the text editor Atom just in case you want to play around with the code or even start your own OCaml project!

> Justin swears by Visual Studio Code over Atom ("AND I'LL TAKE THAT TO MY GRAVE, THE INTEGRATED TERMINAL IS A LIFESAVER!")
> 
> To use VS Code with OCaml just download it from the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and then once it is open install the following extensions from its Extension Marketplace.
> 
> - Code Outline
> - Reason
> - OCaml (You shouldn't need this one because Reason should do everything this one does and more but if you run into any problems consider installing this one as well)

### Playing The Game

Once OCaml has been installed and the Repo files downloaded (or in the case of the graders for the project, unzipping ovegassrc.zip):

 1. Navigate to the folder that contains the project files by using `cd` in your Terminal/Command Prompt
 2. Type `make play` and hit enter
 3. After it loads you are now in the game!
